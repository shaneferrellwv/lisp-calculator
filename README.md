# Lisp-Inspired Calculator in Java

This project is a Lisp-inspired calculator implemented in Java, utilizing the simplicityof Lisp's parenthesized expressions for mathematical operations. The calculator leverages Java's `BigDecimal` class for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, ensuring high precision and scalability in calculations.

## Features

- **Arbitrary-Precision Calculations:** Utilizes Java's `BigDecimal` for calculations with a customizable scale and precision, allowing for precise mathematical operations beyond standard floating-point arithmetic.
- **Lisp-Inspired Syntax:** Embraces Lisp's simple and powerful s-expression syntax for writing expressions, making the code easy to parse and highly readable.
- **Supported Variables:** Includes support for mathematical constants `e` and `pi`.
- **Supported Functions:** Offers a suite of 10 mathematical functions:
  - `add` (addition)
  - `sub` (subtraction)
  - `mul` (multiplication)
  - `div` (division)
  - `pow` (power)
  - `sqrt` (square root)
  - `rem` (remainder)
  - `mod` (modulus)
  - `sin` (sine)
  - `cos` (cosine)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. This project is built and tested with Java 11 but should be compatible with most Java versions.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/shaneferrellwv/lisp-calculator
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd lisp-calculator
```


### Usage

1. Compile the Java files in your project directory. 

2. Run the Calculator program with your desired expression. For example:

```
(add 1 2)
```
